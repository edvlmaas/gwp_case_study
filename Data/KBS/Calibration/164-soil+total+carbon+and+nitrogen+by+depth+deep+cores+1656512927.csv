#2012-1-12. Sven Bohm. Discovered that T4 rep 6 had some sample_dates coded as 2006 rather than 2001. I've corrected the dates.,,,,,,,
#2012-1-13. Sven Bohm. Included the core in the data. In 2001 we only analyzed core 1. I also discovered that the dataset included all the individual approved measurements. I changed it to report one average measurement for each treatment, replicate, depth (section) and core.,,,,,
#2019-3-28 Sven Bohm. treatment T1 replicate 1 station 1 and 2  and T6 rep 1 station 5 had samples that were re-run and the re-run samples were coded with the wrong sample dates,  This resulted in two sample dates for those stations in the output dataset. I updated the sample_dates on the rerun samples and excluded the original samples from the dataset.,,,,,,
